\title{Unpack JSTOR journal articles and bibliographic data to a Document Term Matrix of 1-grams}
\usage{
JSTOR_unpack1grams(parallel = FALSE, path = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{parallel}{if TRUE, apply function in parallel, using the parallel library. Default is FALSE as this is typically faster for smaller datasets (ie. ~5000 articles) due to communication overhead.}

\item{path}{full path to directory containing 'wordcounts' folder and the citations.CSV file. These are obtained after unzipping the file downloaded from DfR (you should unzip the file before running this function). Default is the working directory.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of two items. First is "wordcounts", a Document Term Matrix of 1-grams, and second is 'bibliodata', a data frame of bibliographic information for all articles.
}
\description{
Import journal articles and bibliographic data from the downloaded zipfile and reshape ready for simple text mining. For use with JSTOR's Data for Research datasets (http://dfr.jstor.org/).

\examples{
## unpack1grams <- JSTOR_unpack1grams(path = "C:/Users/marwick/Downloads/JSTOR")
